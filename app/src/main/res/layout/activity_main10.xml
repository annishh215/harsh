Benaulim beaches are pristine, as they are relatively undeveloped.[11] Due to reduced human movement during the coronavirus lockdown, five adult Olive Ridley turtles washed up on Benaulim beach after decades, in June 2020. The turtles were trapped in fishing nets on the beach and were rescued by Benaulim fisherman Pele and his friends."
